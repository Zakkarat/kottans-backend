Had already accomplished tasks in frontend course. [Check it out!](https://github.com/Zakkarat/kottans-frontend)

Also providing screenshot for new Unix-Shell task

## Memory Management

- What's going to happen if program reaches maximum limit of stack ?

If the maximum stack size has been reached, we have a stack overflow and the program receives a Segmentation Fault.

- What's going to happen if program requests a big (more then 128KB) memory allocation on heap ? 

The heap is enlarged via the brk() system call (implementation) to make room for the requested block.

- What's the difference between Text and Data memory segments ?

The string lives in the text segment, which is read-only and stores all of your code in addition to tidbits like string literals.
The data segment, on the other hand, holds the contents for static variables initialized in source code. This memory area is not anonymous.

## HTTP & HTTPS

```bash
curl https://api.github.com/users/zakkarat
```
```bash
curl -i https://api.github.com/users/zakkarat
```
```bash
curl --user "USERNAME" https://api.github.com/gists/starred
```
```bash
curl -i https://api.github.com/orgs/kottans/repos
```
```bash
curl -u zakkarat:***** -d "{ \"title\" : \"test\" }" https://api.github.com/repos/zakkarat/kottans-backend/issues
```
- Name at least three possible negative consequences of not using https.

First of all, possible it would be a man in the middle attack, when data is being changed to fake data somewhere in the middle of the sending process. Secondly, data can be captured and read by someone else(Not actual data receiver). Finally, without certification, the user won't know if he is connected to the actual site, so the user's data could be stolen by the attacker.

- Explain the main idea behind public key cryptography in few sentences.

The idea behind the public key is to make sure that only specified users get data. There are two types of keys: public and private. Data can be encrypted by one of them, but must be decrypted by another. For example, if we have data encrypted by the public key, it can only be decrypted by the private key. It provides assurance, that we get data from trusted users, moreover, It makes impossible to access data for attackers.

- You are creating and application for pet clinic. You need to implement the following functionality.

1. add new pet: It will be kind of POST request with the appropriate parameters in a JSON file.
2. search pet by name: It will be a GET request using query to specify the name. Example: `/search?name=<name>`.
3. change name of an existing pet: We will use PUT, because we are updating an existing resource. In path we will provide name of needed pet and the new name in request body.
4. add new info about pet health. It will be a POST request with a provided info in JSON in request body. However it also could be a PUT request, depends on how data is stored.
5. assign a pet to a particular doctor in the clinic: It will be PUT request with doctor information provided in JSON file in request body.
6. register an appointment for a pet: Surely, it will be a POST request with a provided pet info and appointment date in request body.

<p>About Software Architecture course, It is a really long course and I believe that It could be much shorter, but it contains a lot of valuable information. For example, I have OOP subject in my university and we have already done some UML diagrams, but I wish that I had watched this course before getting them done with OOA and so on.</p>
